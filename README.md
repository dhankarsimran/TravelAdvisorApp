Hey!
This is my TravelApp through which you can search all the famous and not so famous restaurants, hotels, attractions according to the ratings you want.
In this app I have used Google Maps API along with giving it a nice looking UI.
You can not only search but also can see thier websites, certifications, type of food, reviews, address, phone no. and so on...
You will see a card format in a separate view as well as in the map itself. Also can move the map according to your will to find the place.
This is a user-friendly app and is fully responsive.

A glance of it:
